# Matrix Multiplication Implementation



#In this practice Python language is used on Windows
 
#Step by step of the repository:

 At first, the new directory should be created by the following command: 
mkdir matrix-multiplication
cd matrix-multiplication

initialised repository created by below command:
git init

The basic version of the code is created in Python.
Check the Python VScode matrix.py

the .gitignore file created


Create develop brache
git checkout -b development

The profile_matrix.py was created to Make Improvements in the Development Branch
Check the profile_matrix file 

The requirement file, as a text file, is created 
See the requirements.txt

Merge Development into Main is created by the following command: 
git checkout main
git merge development
# Or for rebase:
git checkout development
git rebase main
git checkout main
git merge development

Create README.md 
This repository contains implementations of matrix multiplication in Python, with performance optimisations.

To run the program, insert the following command:
python matrix.py

## Implementations

1. **Naive Implementation**: Basic triple-nested loop implementation.
2. **Optimised Implementation**: Uses list comprehensions for better performance.



## Usage

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
